The book [*Learn SQL The Hard Way*](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/), is currently in alpha.

It is free to use.

**Note:** I have not included the sqlite3 database files, but they are easly built using the sql scripts.

**Finished** the book. It goes up to 15, but only 14 are coding exercises.
